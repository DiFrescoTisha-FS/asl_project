* Created Changelog

* After confusion about GitHub expectations, I created a dev branch (wasn't supposed to), and all of my assignments ran together because I moved on the next activity when I got stuck on the first one. Rather than going back and seperating the code and getting rid of the dev branch, I decided to create a new repository and start over. Instructions are still not very clear, but making the before mentioned mistakes helped me to determine what I am not supposed to do and have a better understanding of what I am supposed to do. Hopefully this time around my repository will be formatted correctly.

* Installed dependencies

* Set up file structure

* Set up project board and created issues

* Pushed code to main branch when all setup was complete and switched to a new branch for the first activity.

* Not successful with figuring out the first problem of "Activity: Advanced Routing Using Express" Successful with second and third problems

* Have to move on to the next activity

* I am still trying to figure out how to get the correct curl format to use in order to correctly answer the first problem of "Activity: Advanced Routing Using Express". I am able to get everything to work in my code and display the correct information in the browser, but using curl with this GET request is not working.

* I have taken all screenshots that demonstrate all of the routes being requested and their outputs. I was only able to use code to get the results. I can't keep trying for I am out of time.

* This is my final entry

2022-10-05

* I finally finished my video demonstration of how I can use the curl commands perform various tasks by using DELETE, POST, or GET verbs and displaying the results in the browser.

* This is my final entry for this activity

2022-10-05

* Beginning week 2 lessons and activities

* Worked hard today trying to get my project to work right. Everything was working right except for the edit, which would bring back a blank id and name, and the create link did not show on page. I followed the same error instructor has in the video, but the solution did not work. Now I've crashed my server. Trying to find the issue.

* Another day spent trying to figure out how to work with Twig. I know most of what I need to understand how to get my project to function properly lies in the views. I must learn how the controller, model, and partials tie in together to make the form partial work. With the help of my instructor, I was finally able to get the create link to show up and function. Now I just have to figure out the edit functionality and also the delete. 

* 2022-10-08

* Found a solution for the delete functionality, and added price to my products. However, now I'm getting "Error: Failed to lookup view "home" in views directory "/Users/tishadifresco/Projects/asl_project/templates"", and I'm not able to see my products page. 
Will have to resolve it tomorrow.
