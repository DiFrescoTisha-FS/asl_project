# Changelog
* All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

2022-10-03
* Created Changelog

* After confusion about GitHub expectations, I created a dev branch (wasn't supposed to), and all of my assignments ran together because I moved on the next activity when I got stuck on the first one. Rather than going back and seperating the code and getting rid of the dev branch, I decided to create a new repository and start over. Instructions are still not very clear, but making the before mentioned mistakes helped me to determine what I am not supposed to do and have a better understanding of what I am supposed to do. Hopefully this time around my repository will be formatted correctly.

* Installed dependencies

* Set up file structure

* Set up project board and created issues

* Pushed code to main branch when all setup was complete and switched to a new branch for the first activity.

* Not successful with figuring out the first problem of "Activity: Advanced Routing Using Express" Successful with second and third problems

* Have to move on to the next activity 

2022-10-04

* I am still trying to figure out how to get the correct curl format to use in order to correctly answer the first problem of "Activity: Advanced Routing Using Express". I am able to get everything to work in my code and display the correct information in the browser, but using curl with this GET request is not working.

* I have taken all screenshots that demonstrate all of the routes being requested and their outputs. I was only able to use code to get the results. I can't keep trying for I am out of time.

* This is my final entry

2022-10-05

* I finally finished my video demonstration of how I can use the curl commands perform various tasks by using DELETE, POST, or GET verbs and displaying the results in the browser.

* This is my final entry for this activity

2022-10-05

* Beginning week 2 lessons and activities

* Worked hard today trying to get my project to work right. Everything was working right except for the edit, which would bring back a blank id and name, and the create link did not show on page. I followed the same error instructor has in the video, but the solution did not work. Now I've crashed my server. Trying to find the issue.

2022-10-07

* Another day spent trying to figure out how to work with Twig. I know most of what I need to understand how to get my project to function properly lies in the views. I must learn how the controller, model, and partials tie in together to make the form partial work. With the help of my instructor, I was finally able to get the create link to show up and function. Now I just have to figure out the edit functionality and also the delete. 

2022-10-08

* Found a solution for the delete functionality, and added price to my products. However, now I'm getting "Error: Failed to lookup view "home" in views directory "/Users/tishadifresco/Projects/asl_project/templates"", and I'm not able to see my products page. 
Will have to resolve it tomorrow.

2022-10-09

* Today, there were a lot of ups and downs. One thing was a success, then something else would break or not function. I never got the edit to work correctly when I thought it was but I am now out of time.

2022-10-15

* I haven't been keeping up with changelog since I have been working diligently to try to repair major issues from last week. I totally crashed my server, but today my instructor got everything fixed so that I'm good to go now. I will continue to work on the project until it is completed. Mr. Workman saved the day and gave me an extension! Now I must go and make the best of this given opportunity.

2022-10-18

* It's getting harder to keep up with this changelog as I'm so focused on finishing my project on time. I really struggled with migratiions and models,and being honest, I even struggled with the database. Making so many errors and fixing them (many times with instructors help) was a great way for me to learn. I have all of the commands memorized and feel that I am better prepared to handle what comes next. I finally finished week 3 material and will be moving on to week 4.

2022-10-24

* It has been a struggle to complete this project. I had a major success today, I got my images to show!! But now my edit and create functioning is off. I hope to be done by tomorrow so I can submit it for a grade. I can't wait to see it completely working.

2022-10-25

* This will be my last entry for this class. I submitted my e-commerce project, although there are major flaws in my work. I hope to have help from my instructor to fix the errors I have so I can use this store as part of my EPK.
